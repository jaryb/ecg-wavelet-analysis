# ecg-wavelet-analysis

Wavelets are a great tool in performing time-frequency decomposition of signals similar to why a short time fourier transform can be used. In this project, I use the NeuroKit2 library to simulate a short ECG signal and then perform a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) on the data using three different wavelet types: the complex morlet wavelet, the mexican hat or ricker wavelet, and then a custom wavelet (a sort of cross between the ricker wavelet and sinc function). This project was mainly just for me to learn more about wavelets and the theory/application behind them.
